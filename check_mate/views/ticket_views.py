# when the first ticket is added to a project, set the project status to active, set ticket status to not started
# When task is added to a ticket keep status as not started, until a task is set to active, or the ticket settings are manually overwritten
# While tasks are active in ticket, keep ticket status set to active
# Once all tasks are marked as complete, update ticket status to complete
